## Black Swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes)

Due to their appetite for introduced garden plants, Black Swallowtail caterpillars can be  viewed as a pest by some herb gardeners.  

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Plants of the Carrot family including: Parsley, Dill, Fennel, Queen Anne's Lace, Cowbane,  Chervil

## Monarch (Danaus plexippus) 

Monarchs are strong fliers and can fly 1000km without stopping. Some monarchs cross  600km of open ocean migrating to their overwintering sites in Mexico. Some Monarch  populations migrate from Canada to Mexico and back. 

Monarch caterpillars consume milkweed, sequestering cardiac glycoside toxins.

The Monarch was declared **endangered** by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on 22 July 2022.

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Milkweeds and other plants of the Dogbane family. Mowing and human intrusion is negatively impacting milkweed availability and may be affecting Monarch populations.

### Mimicked by

- Viceroy Butterfly
- Queen (ventral wing only, a  tropical butterfly)

## Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor) 

Pipevine is a native deciduous vine with large, heart-shaped leaves. Some gardeners plant it to encourage butterfly activity. The pipevine caterpillar consumes plants and sequesters the toxic aristolochic acid making them distasteful to birds. 

Patent medicine salesman of the American Wild West sold medicines made from the snakeroot plant. Whether this is the source of *"snake oil"* or it was actual oil from snakes, is not entirely clear. In any case, birds have clearly seen no medicinal benefit in eating the Pipevine Swallowtail. 

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Plants in the Birthwort family, including: Dutchman's Pipe and Virginia Snakeroot.

### Mimicked by

 - Black Swallowtail
 - Spicebush Swallowtail
 - Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (dark form female)
 - Diana Fritillaries
 - Red-spotted 
 - Purples

## Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus) 

Spicebush Swallowtails are a threatened butterfly species due to introduced Laurel Wilt Fungus that kills their host plants. Spicebush Swallowtail caterpillars, as with most caterpillars, will not survive if they are unable to feed on their host plants. 

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Spicebush, Sassafras Tree, Red Bay, Camphor Tree

## Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus)

Female Tiger Swallowtails have either a yellow, intermediate, or dark color form. All male 
Tiger Swallowtails are yellow. In butterflies the chromosomes are opposite of mammals. 
Female butterflies have the XY chromosomes and with Eastern Tiger Swallowtails, the gene 
for color is on the Y chromosome. Dark colored females give birth to dark colored females 
and do not have yellow female offspring. In parts of North America, female yellow Eastern 
Tiger Swallowtails are rare giving evidence of the effectiveness of mimicry.

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Tulip Poplar, Sweet Bay Magnolia, Black Cherry, Green Ash

## Viceroy (Limenitis archippus)

Viceroys are not related to Monarch butterflies. They effectively mimic Monarchs and it is 
not unusual to find publications about Monarchs incorrectly showing a picture of a Viceroy 
instead. 

Viceroys are from the genus of Admiral butterflies and Monarchs are from the 
genus of Milkweed butterflies. Viceroys use many defenses during their lifecycle to avoid 
being eaten. Caterpillars mimic bird droppings and eat willows which make them 
distasteful. Adult butterflies mimic Monarchs. 

### Caterpillar Host Plants 

Willows, Cottonwood
